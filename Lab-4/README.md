# Decision Making & Menu Driven Programs in C
This lab contains multiple C programs demonstrating the use of decision-making structures (if, if-else, switch) and validation in real-world scenarios. Programs include attendance checking, electricity usage classification, number type determination, login authentication, ATM menu, grading system, discount calculation, and a scientific calculator.
## Objectives
- Practice decision-making using if, if-else, and logical operators.
- Implement switch-case for menu-driven programs with proper input handling.
- Validate inputs and apply correct formulas for calculations.
- Apply programming concepts in real-world scenarios like grading, ATM services, and shopping discounts.
- Develop a scientific calculator handling arithmetic and basic scientific operations.
## Lab Tasks

1. **Student Attendance Eligibility** - Checks if a student can sit for exams based on attendance percentage.  
2. **Electricity Bill Usage Checker** - Classifies users based on electricity units consumed.  
3. **Number Classification System** - Determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero.  
4. **Login Authentication System** - Verifies predefined username and password.  
5. **ATM Menu System** - Menu-driven ATM with balance inquiry, withdrawal, deposit, and exit.  
6. **Grade Evaluation System** - Assigns grades based on marks in 5 subjects.  
7. **Discount Calculator** - Calculates discounts based on total purchase amount.  
8. **Scientific Calculator Using Switch** - Performs arithmetic and basic scientific calculations with input validation.
